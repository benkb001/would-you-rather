    TODO: This class will be the view where users can see and select
    between two options,
    it has a post_id string, a question string,
    and two option strings.
    at first it displays the question, username of author, and
    the two choices, after the user has clicked
    one of the choices it will call Backend.choose(option, username, post_id),
    option will be an int (either 0 or 1 for left/right option),
    which will return a JSONObject that contains the updated counts
    for each option to let the user know how their answer compares.
    Probably display both the absolute counts and the percentages
