1. We need to either access an android app or some hardware,
my two ideas are either a voice input so users can
narrate their question/options, or make it so it will go to
the next post if the user shakes the device (accelerometer)
Any other ideas appreciated :)

2. My current scope for the project is this:
users can sign up and sign in, each has a username and password
users can post new questions. others will see the username of who posted it
users can answer questions and see how their response compares

If we want, we could add another view where users can see
a list of all the posts they have made and how many people have
responded and how they responded. or any other additions we want.
but probably the above is enough to get full credit.
